# TOFU

Welcome!

Guess what? Yup, that's another game engine/framework.

## Pros

* C99 code only.
* Self-contained, no external modules/libraries required.
* Multi-platform.

## Cons

* **Wren** is not as popular as others (e.g. **Lua** or **JavaScript**), which translates into less ready-to-use code.

## Uses

* [Wren](https://wren.io/)
* [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) v2.3-dev
* [jsmn](https://zserge.com/jsmn.html/) v1.0.0
