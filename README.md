# Tofu Engine

Welcome!

Guess what? Yup, that's another game engine/framework.

## Pros

* C99 code only.
* Self-contained, no external modules/libraries required.
* Multi-platform.

## Cons

* **Wren** is not as popular as others (e.g. **Lua** or **JavaScript**), which translates into less *ready-to-use* code. However, embedding is much more seamless than with **Lua**.

## Uses

* [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) v2.3-dev
* [Wren](https://wren.io/) v0.1.0
* [jsmn](https://zserge.com/jsmn.html/) v1.0.0

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement a *smarter* string library (not too distant from C strings).
- [ ] Use a custom memory-management allocator.
- [ ] Support for TARed/ZIPed games ([rxi/microtar](https://github.com/rxi/microtar), [kuba--/zip](https://github.com/kuba--/zip)).
- [ ] Switch to Vulkan API.

## Inspirations

* [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/)
* [DOME Engine](https://github.com/avivbeeri/dome/blob/master/src/vm.c)
